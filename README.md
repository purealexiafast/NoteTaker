# Note Taker Assignment

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

The assignment was to connect Express.js back end to the front end of an application that saves notes, called a Note Taker. The application saves and retrieves data. A bonus was to also delete data. I found this assignment very challenging. The syntax was new to me, however I was able to solve it and deploy the application to Heroku.
